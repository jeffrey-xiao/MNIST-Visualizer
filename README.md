# MNIST-Visualizer
## Summary
Flushed out MNIST Visualizer that classifies handwritten digits, outputs the probabilities of each digit, and visualizes the hidden layers of the convolutional neural network.

The library used by the application can be found [here](https://github.com/jeffrey-xiao/Machine-Learning-Library).

The weights used by the application can be found [here](https://github.com/jeffrey-xiao/Machine-Learning-Library/tree/master/data/mnist_cnn_weights.txt).

The first 16 images on the right represent the activated values after the first max pooling layer. 

The next 32 images represent the activated values after the second max pooling layer.
